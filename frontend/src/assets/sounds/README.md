# Sound Assets

This directory contains sound effects used in the application.

Sound effects should be placed here if they are:
1. Imported and processed through the build system
2. Need to be optimized or transformed
3. Are part of the core application functionality

For static sound files that need to be served directly, use the `/public` directory instead.
