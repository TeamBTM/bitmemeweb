# Image Assets

This directory contains image assets used in the application.

Images should be placed here if they are:
1. Imported directly into components
2. Need to be processed through the build system
3. Require optimization or transformation
4. Are part of the core application functionality

For static images that need to be served directly without processing, use the `/public` directory instead.
